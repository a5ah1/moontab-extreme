# Privacy Policy for Link Stacker

**Effective Date:** 18 July 2025

## Overview

Link Stacker is a Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a customizable link organizer. This privacy policy explains our data practices in clear, simple terms.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.**

Link Stacker operates entirely on your local device and does not communicate with external servers to collect or process your personal information.

## Local Data Storage

Link Stacker stores the following information locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:

- Your saved links and column organization
- Theme preferences and custom CSS
- Background images you upload
- Extension settings and configurations

**Important:** All of this data remains on your device only. We cannot access it, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Favicon Display

To display website icons next to your saved links, Link Stacker may fetch favicons from Google's public favicon service. This is purely for visual enhancement and does not involve collecting or transmitting any of your personal data.

## Third-Party Services

Link Stacker does not integrate with any third-party analytics, tracking, or data collection services.

## Data Sharing

Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.
